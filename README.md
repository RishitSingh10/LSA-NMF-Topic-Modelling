# LSA-NMF-Topic-Modelling

In this project around 344 research papers from well known conferences were extracted to prepare a text corpus.
Then Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) or Truncated SVD and subsequently Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) was used to perform topic modelling on this text corpus.
As an evaluation metrics Pairwise Cosine-similarity was used.
